# Hi there, I'm Emin Haziyev! 👋

I’m a multidisciplinary developer shaping digital experiences that linger in memory. My work lives at the intersection of functional engineering and thoughtful design, where structure and aesthetics quietly collaborate.

Grounded in computer science and inspired by the arts, I approach every project with a broadened lens. To me, code isn’t just a utility; it’s a medium for crafting emotion, clarity, and meaning.

Outside the editor, you’ll find me deep in a good book 📚, sharpening my focus through judo 🥋, chasing clarity on a run 🏃‍♂️, or recharging outdoors 🌳 where ideas tend to arrive unannounced.
